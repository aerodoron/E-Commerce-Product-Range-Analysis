Hereinafter I will take the following steps:

1. Overview of the Data - Description of the Dataset;
2. Initial Exploration -
    * Description of the Dataset;
    * Loading of Libraries and of Dataset;
    * Initial Data Exploration.
3. Data Preprocessing - 
    * Turning columns' names and values to lowercase/uppercase;
    * Checking for missing values and treating them - leaving them be, filling them in or removing them;
    * Looking for duplicates (values and rows);
    * Explore the negative values in the data.
